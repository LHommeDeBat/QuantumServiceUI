# QuantumServiceUI

The QuantumServiceUI enables users to use a web-ui to interact with the [QuantumService (Filesystem-Alternative)](https://github.com/LHommeDeBat/QuantumServiceMessaging).

## How to run

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.0. 
The easiest way to run the UI is to run a developement server:

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

The host and port of the [QuantumService (Filesystem-Alternative)](https://github.com/LHommeDeBat/QuantumServiceMessaging) can be changed within the **environment.ts** in case your backend setup is not using the default host (localhost) and port (9005).
